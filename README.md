# ADoSnipsIrrigation

Switch on garden irrigation.

The skill is written in Julia based on the QnD-framework.
Current version of the documentation can be visited here:

 [Framework Documentation](https://andreasdominik.github.io/ADoSnipsQnD/dev)

## Intents

The skill uses the OnOff-intend of the framework

## 'config.ini'

The duration and number of repeats of the watering is
configured in the `config.ini`. In order to make changes possible
without restart of the Snips-services, the `config.ini` is read every time
the `start` action is executed.

# Julia

This skill is (like the entire SnipsHermesQnD framework) written in the
modern programming language Julia (because Julia is faster
then Python and coding is much much easier and much more straight forward).
However "Pythonians" often need some time to get familiar with Julia.

This is a template skill for the SnipsHermesQnD framework for Snips.ai
written in Julia.
